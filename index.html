                        <p>I, Sujit Debnath, previously worked as Project Coordinator at the Department of Analytics Center of Excellence, <a href="https://www.robi.com.bd/en" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Robi Axiata Limited</a>. Before shifting into the industry, I had the opportunity to work simultaneously as a Teaching Assistant (TA) and a Lab Instructor at the <a href="http://ece.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Department of Electrical and Computer Engineering</a> of <a href="http://www.northsouth.edu" target="_blank" style="color: black;">North South University (NSU)</a>.</p>
                        <p>I have completed my Bachelor of Science in Computer Science and Engineering (CSE) from NSU along with the distinction <i>magna cum laude</i>. The university awarded me a merit-based tuition waiver from the second semester until my graduation for excellent academic performances. Additionally, I was also one of the top 5% graduates among the entire 'Graduating Class of 2019' (3470 graduates). Before that, I attended the Secondary School Certificate (SSC) examination from Rampura Ekramunnesa Boys' High School and Higher Secondary Certificate (HSC) examination from Dhaka College.</p>
                        <p>I am interested in Machine Learning (ML) and Data Science, particularly devising a better problem-solving method for intricate tasks. Indeed, it is superfluous to say that data is an essential part of our daily lives in the data-driven era. With that, Data Science and Artificial Intelligence (AI) have emerged as one of the most crucial components to keep pace with the current world. Humongous data is generated every second, and deriving meaning from this ocean of data fascinates me. Due to the growing passion for ML, Data Science, and research, I started my research journey in the biomedical field on '<a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/IS.2018.8710490" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Glaucoma (group of eye conditions) detection</a>' using Fuzzy Logic. Later, during the ML course, I had the opportunity to work on '<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sujitdebnath/sujitdebnath.github.io/master/src/resources/cse445_stroke_risk_prediction_report.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Early Risk Prediction of Stroke</a>,' where we used various ML algorithms to predict stroke risk. These research works helped me to explore research methodologies more closely and encouraged me to engage deeply in research. Afterward, as my undergraduate thesis, I wanted to explore another prominent domain of ML- Natural Language Processing (NLP), as there has been very little NLP research in Bengali, though it is one of the most extensively spoken languages of the world. Therefore, I did my undergraduate thesis on '<a href="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sujitdebnath/sujitdebnath.github.io/master/src/resources/senior_year_thesis.pdf" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Kothamala - A Bangla Speech Recognition Engine</a>,' where we conducted this research-based project in two divisions; one was <a href="https://doi.org/10.1109/ICBSLP.2018.8554395" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Bengali Short Speech Commands Recognition</a>, and the other one was Bengali Transcription.</p>
                        <p>Besides my undergraduate studies, I was involved with several organizations, including <a href="http://nsuproblemsolvers.com" target="_blank" style="color: black;">NSU Problem Solvers (NSUPS)</a>, <a href="https://jaago.com.bd" target="_blank" style="color: black;">JAAGO Foundation</a>, and <a href="https://vbd.com.bd" target="_blank" style="color: black;">Volunteer for Bangladesh (VBD)</a>. I started working as a volunteer at VBD, Dhaka division in 2014, which is a non-political volunteer and youth wing of JAAGO. However, involvement with several organizations and working as a volunteer in several social communities significantly polished my interpersonal and social skills.</p>
                        <p>Personally, I am a slightly introverted person who loves to read books of different genres, e.g., thriller, mystery, fantasy, science fiction, classic, etc. Moreover, I invariably try to be contented and to evolve myself every day for the upcoming days with new challenges. Because I always remember the following quote by George Bernard Shaw,</p>
                        <q>Life isn't about finding yourself. Life is about creating yourself.</q>

                                            Diabetes Mellitus, more commonly known as diabetes, is a chronic disease that involves abnormally high levels of glucose sugar in blood cells and the usage of insulin in the human body. 
                                            This article has focused on analyzing diabetes patients as well as detection of diabetes using different Machine Learning techniques to build up a model with a few dependencies based on the PIMA dataset. 
                                            The model has been tested on an unseen portion of PIMA and also on the dataset collected from <span style="font-style: italic;">Kurmitola General Hospital, Dhaka, Bangladesh</span>. 
                                            The research is conducted to demonstrate the performance of several classifiers trained on a particular country’s diabetes dataset and tested on patients from a different country. We have evaluated decision tree, K-nearest neighbor, random forest, and Naïve Bayes in this research and the results show that both random forest and Naïve Bayes classifier performed well on both datasets.</p> -->

                                        <!-- <p> <strong style="font-style: italic;"> Abstract: </strong> With the proliferation of internet users around the world, it is becoming imperative to make communications safer than before. A network intrusion detection system is 
                                            pivotal fornetwork security because it enables us to detect and respond to malicious traffics. There are several ways and available tools to detect attacks in a computer network but machine learning techniques are one of the 
                                            most efficient methods to detectabnormal traffics precisely and accurately. In this work, a method has been demonstrated to classify if incoming network traffic is normal or anomalous using machine learning techniques. 
                                            Several classifiers have been evaluated based on the NSL-KDD dataset. Experiments were conducted with k-nearest neighbor, decision tree, naive Bayes, logistic regression, random forest, and their ensemble approach. 
                                            A basic feature selection strategy has  been applied to reduce the calculation time complexity and dataset’s dimension. The highest accuracy obtained 99.5% with a 0.6% false alarm rate. </p> -->

                                        <!-- <p> <strong style="font-style: italic;"> Abstract: </strong> Diabetes is a major non-communicable disease that is responsible for many associated health risks and is rapidly increasing in low and middle income countries like Bangladesh. 
                                            Class imbalance existing in datasets is a dire issue that can result the predictions of diabetes to be biased towards the majority class - thus reducing the reliability of machine learning models. Considering the associated risks of 
                                            diabetes, a decrease in recall can result in life threatening consequences. In order to tackle this problem, a cost-sensitive learning and synthetic minority oversampling technique (SMOTE) have been applied on the PIMA Indian dataset. 
                                            After that, the models have been tested on PIMA test set as well as on dataset collected from Kurmitola General Hospital (KGH), Dhaka, Bangladesh. Our results demonstrate that this proposed approach has successfully improved the reliability of the previous ML models to predict diabetes among Bangladeshi female population. </p> -->

                                        <!-- <p> <strong style="font-style: italic;"> Abstract: </strong> This paper indicates a design in which a system will be capable to trace a vehicle's petrol refill amount, cost & time then notifies the vehicle's owner about the refill as well. 
                                            The system is divided into two parts: A mobile application and a petrol pump. The users will use the mobile app to register themselves to the system and control their accounts. The users will also have an RFID which will work as a prepaid card. 
                                            They can recharge the card from any authorized recharge point. The deduction of fuel from the pump for each individual will be automatic after scanning the RFID card and providing a unique password. Cost of fuel will be charged from the RFID 
                                            card and at the same time, the user will be notified via realtime email technology. All the information of transactions (e.g. refill amount, refill type, refill cost, current balance, previous balance, transaction time etc.) will be sent to a 
                                            database through Wi-Fi technology. This system has interconnected the pump and the mobile app by a central and secure database so that they can communicate between themselves. The database is accessible from any corner across the world and the 
                                            users will be able to trace their account through the mobile application at anytime from anywhere. This system can also measure the level of fuel inside the petrol bunk. The goal of this system is to avoid dishonesty of pump laborers & car 
                                            drivers toward the car owners and provide a secure fuel monitoring method with low labor cost. </p> -->
